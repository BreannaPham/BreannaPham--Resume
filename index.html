        <p class="lead mb-4">As a fresh high school graduate coming into college, I did not know what to expect. I remember my feelings being all over the place. I was excited, nervous, but mostly I was scared to be lonely. After reading, ‚ÄúSuccess Comes From You‚Äù by Dr. Christina S. Rogers, I learned that every emotion I felt was valid. The book taught me things that I didn‚Äôt even know about myself, and helped me guide my feelings along with the various situations I went through in the first quarter of Riverside. 
In chapter one Rogers states, ‚ÄúBy challenging yourself and trying new things in life, you can observe and learn how you behave in new situations.‚Äù This really resonated with me because during welcome week I remember contemplating if I wanted to attend one of the freshman events by myself. Since my roommate I knew from back home wasn‚Äôt there I felt scared to be around new people I did not know. Sometimes I get social anxiety and it overwhelms me when too many people are in one place. I eventually got myself up to go and since it was the ‚ÄúPre-business Meet and Greet‚Äù, I met a bunch of new people in the same major as me. As I look back and reflect on those few hours, I realize I am actually good at making new friends and interacting with my peers. If I never pushed myself to attend that event, I would have never figured out one of the many good traits that I have. 
I made a few new friends that I still constantly talk to today. I remember they were all feeling the same thing as me, nervous. We bonded over the same things like how being a business major seemed the easiest. Little did I know, some of the courses were so difficult. In chapter two Rogers taught me how to make good decisions. Since calculus was the hardest class for me, I decided to follow her steps in order to achieve my goal (at the time) which was passing my midterm. She says, ‚Äúif you understand the reason why you have made a particular decision, you will be better equipped to stand by it‚Äù. This stuck with me because I made the decision to take calculus as a first year knowing it was going to be hard because math wasn‚Äôt one of my strongest subjects. Since I settled with this difficult math class, I knew I had to try my hardest to do well. 
As college freshmans, it is ingrained into our heads that we are supposed to have fun and go to as many parties as we could to live out our ‚Äúcollege‚Äù experience. I am not going to lie, picking between the choice to go out or study for the exam was hard. Step two of Roger‚Äôs decision making was to ‚Äúgather all the necessary information that can directly impact the problem.‚Äù So I did exactly that. The problem was that I am bad at math and parties can impact that problem negatively. This leads me onto step three, ‚Äúassess the consequences‚Äù. I knew if I chose a party over studying, I would fail and fall behind. I also had a fear of missing out on all the fun with my friends. Step four was to make a final decision and my decision was to stay in my dorm and study while everyone went out to have fun. I successfully passed my midterm with a 97% but that cost me weeks of no participation with what I actually wanted to do. 
<br><br>

        I am very excited to become a business major.<br><br>

        I can't wait to advance my job and work as I climb the ladder to success.
